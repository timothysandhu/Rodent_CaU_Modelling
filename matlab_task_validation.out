      Rhat: 1
    vhat_1: 0.6798
       h_1: 0.0047

 
Parameter estimates for the observation model:
    ze: 0.7038

Model quality:
    LME (more is better): -104.5136
    AIC (less is better): 177.146
    BIC (less is better): 189.4467
 
    AIC and BIC are approximations to -2*LME = 209.0271.
 
Ignored trials: none
Irregular trials: none
